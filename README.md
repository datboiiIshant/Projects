1. Simple Blackjack game - This is a Python implementation of a simple text-based Blackjack game. It allows a player to play multiple rounds of Blackjack against a computerized dealer.
2. Rock-Paper-Scissor Game: This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. It allows a player to play against the computer by choosing one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors.
3. 1D Heat Equation Solver: This Python script solves the one-dimensional heat equation using finite difference methods. It models the temperature distribution along a rod over time, subject to given parameters such as thermal diffusivity, length of the rod, and total simulation time.
4. 2D Heat Equation Solver: This Python script solves the two-dimensional heat equation using finite difference methods. It models the temperature distribution on a square plate over time, subject to given parameters such as thermal diffusivity, dimensions of the plate, and total simulation time.
5. Double Pipe Heat Exchanger Problem Solver: This Python script solves the Double Pipe Heat Exchanger problem using numerical methods and energy balance equations. It allows users to input parameters such as inlet temperatures, mass flow rates, and specific heat capacities of the hot and cold fluids, and calculates the outlet temperatures and heat transfer rate.
6. Heat Exchanger Class: The HeatExchanger class is a Python implementation for modeling and optimizing heat exchangers. It allows users to define a heat exchanger with specific parameters such as inlet temperature, outlet temperature, heat capacity, and mass flow rate. The class provides methods to calculate the heat transfer within the heat exchanger and to optimize its operation to achieve a target heat transfer.
7. The Credit Card Generator and Validator is a Python script that generates random credit card numbers according to different card types (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover) and validates them using the Luhn's algorithm. It provides functionalities to insert the generated card numbers into a MySQL database and retrieve them for validation. This tool is useful for testing and verifying credit card processing systems.
